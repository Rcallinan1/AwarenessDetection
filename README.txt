How to run Driver Awareness Detection:
1. Open up the Ul.mlapp file
2. On the top you should see a Green arrow button, click on it.
3. From there you can see different buttons, one for takeing a photo from the webcam, one for importing and another for a live video.
4. FYI for the import photo button, this optino works best in a well lit area and the face is directly infront of the photo, not off to the side.
5. If you either took the photo or imported it, you have to press the red detect button inorder to get a result.
6. If you pressed the live button you should notice a new figure pop up with what the webcam sees and your result is displayed on the GUI.
7. Press the exit button when you are done!
